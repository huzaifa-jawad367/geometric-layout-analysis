# geometric-layout-analysis
This repository contain assignment 2 of the course design and analysis of algorithms.
I am using pytesseract to gett the bounding boxes along each word.
We then used these boxes to form a bounding box around the whole line.
We then use topological sort to get the correct arrangement of the content of the document.
